# Distributed Durable Timer Service - Decision Log

This document tracks all major architectural and design decisions made during the development of the distributed durable timer service.

## Decision Entry Format
Each decision should include:
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: Problem being solved or situation requiring a decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Alternatives**: Other options that were considered
- **Impact**: Expected consequences or implications
- **Status**: Active, Superseded, or Deprecated

## Decisions

### [Date: 2024-12-19] Requirements Adherence Rule
- **Context**: During API design, I added features not explicitly specified in requirements (list API, execution history), which violates the principle of building only what's specified
- **Decision**: Add strict requirements adherence rule to project guidelines - implement only what is explicitly documented in requirements
- **Rationale**: Prevents scope creep, maintains project focus, ensures we build exactly what was specified rather than what seems "obvious" or "nice to have"
- **Alternatives**: Allow reasonable feature additions, rely on judgment calls for "obvious" features
- **Impact**: Requires explicit requirements updates for any new features, prevents uncontrolled feature growth
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: 2024-12-19] WebUI Inclusion Decision
- **Context**: Need to decide whether to include a web-based user interface for timer management and monitoring
- **Decision**: Include a comprehensive WebUI as part of the core service offering
- **Rationale**: A WebUI will significantly improve operator experience by providing visual timer management, real-time monitoring, and system health visibility. This reduces the learning curve and operational complexity.
- **Alternatives**: CLI-only interface, separate third-party monitoring tools, API-only approach
- **Impact**: Adds frontend development complexity but greatly improves usability and adoption potential
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: TBD] Initial Architecture Decision
- **Context**: Need to choose the overall architecture for the distributed timer service
- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be filled]
- **Alternatives**: [To be documented]
- **Impact**: [To be assessed]
- **Status**: Pending

### [Date: 2024-12-19] API Design Decision  
- **Context**: Need to define the REST API structure and data models for the timer service
- **Decision**: Minimal RESTful API with group-based scalability using composite keys {groupId, timerId}, standardized callback response protocol, and enhanced retry policies with duration limits. Full specification: [api.yaml](api.yaml), Design documentation: [docs/design/api-design.md](docs/design/api-design.md)
- **Rationale**: Group-based sharding enables horizontal scaling, composite keys support efficient lookups, CallbackResponse schema provides clear success/failure semantics with rescheduling capability, simplified timer model reduces complexity
- **Alternatives**: Single-key timers, complex status tracking, implicit callback responses, basic retry policies
- **Impact**: Enables horizontal scaling through sharding, clear callback semantics, flexible retry control, simplified client integration
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: 2024-12-19] Group-Based Scalability Decision
- **Context**: Need to design for horizontal scaling to support millions of concurrent timers as specified in requirements
- **Decision**: Implement group-based sharding with composite keys {groupId, timerId} for all timer operations
- **Rationale**: Groups enable horizontal scaling by distributing different groups across service instances, provide workload isolation, and support efficient lookups without expensive list operations
- **Alternatives**: Single global namespace, hash-based sharding, time-based partitioning
- **Impact**: Enables horizontal scaling, requires clients to specify groupId, simplifies sharding logic
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: 2024-12-19] Callback Response Protocol Decision
- **Context**: Need standardized way for callbacks to indicate success/failure and enable timer rescheduling (FR-2.4)
- **Decision**: Define CallbackResponse schema with required 'ok' boolean and optional 'nextExecuteAt' for rescheduling
- **Rationale**: Clear success/failure semantics prevent ambiguous callback responses, enables timer rescheduling capability, standardizes callback contract across all integrations
- **Alternatives**: HTTP status codes only, custom headers, implicit rescheduling logic
- **Impact**: Requires callback endpoints to return structured JSON response, enables powerful rescheduling workflows
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: 2024-12-19] Simplified Timer Model Decision
- **Context**: Need to balance functionality with simplicity to avoid over-engineering
- **Decision**: Remove timer status tracking and nextExecuteAt fields from timer model, handle rescheduling via callback responses only
- **Rationale**: Simplifies data model, reduces state management complexity, focuses on core timer functionality, makes rescheduling explicit via callback interaction
- **Alternatives**: Complex status state machine, persistent next execution tracking, hybrid approaches
- **Impact**: Simplified implementation, requires callback-driven rescheduling, reduces storage complexity
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: 2024-12-19] API Documentation Decision
- **Context**: Need to document API design decisions and rationale for future reference and team alignment
- **Decision**: Create comprehensive API design document at [docs/design/api-design.md](docs/design/api-design.md) covering all design decisions, principles, and examples
- **Rationale**: Centralized documentation ensures team understanding of design choices, facilitates onboarding, and provides reference for future API evolution decisions
- **Alternatives**: Inline API comments only, separate architecture document, wiki-based documentation
- **Impact**: Clear design documentation supports consistent implementation and informed future decisions
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: TBD] Technology Stack Selection
- **Context**: Choose programming languages, frameworks, and core technologies
- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be filled]
- **Alternatives**: [To be documented]
- **Impact**: [To be assessed]
- **Status**: Pending

### [Date: TBD] Storage Backend Choice
- **Context**: Select persistent storage solution for timer data
- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be filled]
- **Alternatives**: [To be documented]
- **Impact**: [To be assessed]
- **Status**: Pending
