## Decisions

### [Date: 2024-12-19] WebUI Inclusion Decision
- **Context**: Need to decide whether to include a web-based user interface for timer management and monitoring
- **Decision**: Include a comprehensive WebUI as part of the core service offering
- **Rationale**: A WebUI will significantly improve operator experience by providing visual timer management, real-time monitoring, and system health visibility. This reduces the learning curve and operational complexity.
- **Alternatives**: CLI-only interface, separate third-party monitoring tools, API-only approach
- **Impact**: Adds frontend development complexity but greatly improves usability and adoption potential
- **Status**: Active

- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be filled]
- **Alternatives**: [To be documented]
- **Impact**: [To be assessed]
- **Status**: Pending

### [Date: TBD] Storage Backend Choice
- **Context**: Select persistent storage solution for timer data
- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be filled]
- **Alternatives**: [To be documented]
- **Impact**: [To be assessed]
