# Distributed Durable Timer Service - Decision Log

This document tracks all major architectural and design decisions made during the development of the distributed durable timer service.

## Decision Entry Format
Each decision should include:
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: Problem being solved or situation requiring a decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Alternatives**: Other options that were considered
- **Impact**: Expected consequences or implications
- **Status**: Active, Superseded, or Deprecated

## Decisions

### [Date: 2024-12-19] Requirements Adherence Rule
- **Context**: During API design, I added features not explicitly specified in requirements (list API, execution history), which violates the principle of building only what's specified
- **Decision**: Add strict requirements adherence rule to project guidelines - implement only what is explicitly documented in requirements
- **Rationale**: Prevents scope creep, maintains project focus, ensures we build exactly what was specified rather than what seems "obvious" or "nice to have"
- **Alternatives**: Allow reasonable feature additions, rely on judgment calls for "obvious" features
- **Impact**: Requires explicit requirements updates for any new features, prevents uncontrolled feature growth
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: 2024-12-19] WebUI Inclusion Decision
- **Context**: Need to decide whether to include a web-based user interface for timer management and monitoring
- **Decision**: Include a comprehensive WebUI as part of the core service offering
- **Rationale**: A WebUI will significantly improve operator experience by providing visual timer management, real-time monitoring, and system health visibility. This reduces the learning curve and operational complexity.
- **Alternatives**: CLI-only interface, separate third-party monitoring tools, API-only approach
- **Impact**: Adds frontend development complexity but greatly improves usability and adoption potential
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: TBD] Initial Architecture Decision
- **Context**: Need to choose the overall architecture for the distributed timer service
- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be filled]
- **Alternatives**: [To be documented]
- **Impact**: [To be assessed]
- **Status**: Pending

### [Date: 2024-12-19] API Design Decision
- **Context**: Need to define the REST API structure and data models for the timer service
- **Decision**: Minimal RESTful API with OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification including only the 4 core timer CRUD operations (POST /timers, GET /timers/{id}, PUT /timers/{id}, DELETE /timers/{id}) - strictly following requirements without any additional endpoints
- **Rationale**: REST API provides familiar interface for developers, OpenAPI spec enables auto-generated documentation and client SDKs. Strict adherence to requirements prevents scope creep and ensures we build exactly what was specified - no health, metrics, or other infrastructure endpoints unless explicitly required.
- **Alternatives**: GraphQL API, gRPC-only API, comprehensive API with additional infrastructure endpoints
- **Impact**: Enables rapid SDK development with minimal API surface. Maintains laser focus on core timer functionality only.
- **Status**: Active

### [Date: TBD] Technology Stack Selection
- **Context**: Choose programming languages, frameworks, and core technologies
- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be filled]
- **Alternatives**: [To be documented]
- **Impact**: [To be assessed]
- **Status**: Pending

### [Date: TBD] Storage Backend Choice
- **Context**: Select persistent storage solution for timer data
- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be filled]
- **Alternatives**: [To be documented]
- **Impact**: [To be assessed]
- **Status**: Pending

- **Technology**: Choice of languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools
- **Design**: API design, data models, and interfaces
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment, scaling, and operational decisions
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and security measures
- **Performance**: Optimization and scalability decisions
