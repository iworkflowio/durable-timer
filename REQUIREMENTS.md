# Distributed Durable Timer Service - Requirements Specification

## Overview
This document defines the requirements for building a distributed, durable timer service that can schedule and execute callbacks at specified times with high reliability and scalability.

---

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Core Timer Operations
- **FR-1.1**: Create one-time timers that execute a callback once at a specified future time
- **FR-1.2**: Timer will include an ID to dedup & lookup, callback url, and a payload to store custom data
- **FR-1.3**: Delete existing timers before they execute
- **FR-1.4**: Update existing timers (change execution time, callback, or payload)
- **FR-1.5**: Query timer status and detailed infomation

### 1.2 Callback Execution
- **FR-2.1**: Support HTTP webhook callbacks, with configurable timeout
- **FR-2.2**: Include timer Id and payload
- **FR-2.3**: Provide configurable retry policies
- **FR-2.4**: Callback can return to update schedule(and other info) for next callback

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Reliability and Availability
- **NFR-1.1**: Achieve 99.9% uptime SLA
- **NFR-1.2**: Guarantee at-least-once delivery semantics for timer callbacks
- **NFR-1.3**: Handle node failures without losing timer state
- **NFR-1.4**: Support timer precision to seconds

### 2.2 Performance and Scalability
- **NFR-2.1**: Support thousands of millions of concurrent active timers
- **NFR-2.2**: Handle 1,000,000+ timer creations and executions per second
- **NFR-2.3**: Execute timers within Â±1 second of scheduled time for sub-minute precision
- **NFR-2.4**: Support horizontal scaling by adding more shards and service instances


### 2.3 Monitoring and Observability
- **NFR-4.1**: Provide comprehensive metrics (timer counts, execution rates, errors)
- **NFR-4.2**: Provide dashboards for operational visibility
- **NFR-4.3**: Log all significant events with proper log levels

## 3. System Requirements

### 3.2 Storage Requirements
- **SR-2.1**: Support multiple storage backends (Cassandra, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- **SR-2.2**: Handle database schema migrations

### 3.3 Integration Requirements
- **SR-3.1**: Integrate with monitoring systems (Prometheus, DataDog, etc.)
- **SR-3.2**: Support configuration via environment variables and config files

---

## 4. API Requirements

### 4.1 REST API
- **AR-1.1**: Provide RESTful HTTP API following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **AR-1.2**: Support JSON request/response format
- **AR-1.3**: Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- **AR-1.4**: Support API versioning strategy
- **AR-1.5**: Provide comprehensive API documentation

## 5. SDK Requirements

### 5.1 Language Support
- **SDK-1.1**: Provide Go SDK
- **SDK-1.2**: Provide Python SDK
- **SDK-1.3**: Provide JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

## 6. WebUI Requirements

### 6.1 Core WebUI Features
- **UI-1.2**: List view of all timers with filtering and pagination
- **UI-1.3**: Create new timers through web form
- **UI-1.4**: View timer details including status, payload
- **UI-1.5**: Cancel existing timers
- **UI-1.6**: Modify timer execution time and payload


### 6.2 User Experience
- **UI-3.1**: Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- **UI-3.2**: Intuitive navigation and user-friendly interface
- **UI-3.3**: Real-time updates without page refresh
- **UI-3.4**: Export timer data (CSV, JSON formats)

## 7. User Experience Requirements

### 7.1 Developer Experience
- **UX-1.1**: Provide clear getting started documentation
- **UX-1.2**: Include code examples for common use cases
- **UX-1.3**: Provide troubleshooting guides
